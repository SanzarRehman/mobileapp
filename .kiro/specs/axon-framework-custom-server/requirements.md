# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a complete Axon Framework solution with Spring Boot that replaces the traditional Axon Server with a custom implementation. The system will consist of two main Spring Boot applications: a main application using the full Axon Framework for CQRS/Event Sourcing, and a custom server application that provides the event store, command routing, and query handling capabilities typically provided by Axon Server. Kafka will be used as the underlying messaging infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the full Axon Framework capabilities without depending on the proprietary Axon Server, so that I have complete control over my event sourcing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize without requiring Axon Server connection
2. WHEN commands are dispatched THEN the custom server SHALL route them to appropriate command handlers
3. WHEN events are published THEN the custom server SHALL store them persistently and distribute them to subscribers
4. WHEN queries are executed THEN the custom server SHALL route them to appropriate query handlers
5. IF the custom server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the custom Axon Server to provide event store capabilities, so that events are persisted reliably and can be replayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are stored THEN the custom server SHALL persist them with proper sequencing and metadata
2. WHEN event replay is requested THEN the custom server SHALL provide events in correct chronological order
3. WHEN concurrent events are stored THEN the custom server SHALL handle them without data corruption
4. WHEN snapshots are created THEN the custom server SHALL store and retrieve them efficiently
5. IF storage fails THEN the custom server SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Kafka as the messaging backbone, so that the system can scale horizontally and handle high throughput.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are published THEN they SHALL be sent to appropriate Kafka topics
2. WHEN commands are dispatched THEN they SHALL be routed through Kafka to the correct handlers
3. WHEN the system scales THEN Kafka SHALL distribute load across multiple instances
4. WHEN network partitions occur THEN Kafka SHALL maintain message delivery guarantees
5. IF Kafka is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages locally until connectivity is restored

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper command and query routing, so that messages reach the correct handlers in a distributed environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is sent THEN the custom server SHALL route it to the correct aggregate instance
2. WHEN a query is executed THEN the custom server SHALL route it to available query handlers
3. WHEN multiple instances handle the same aggregate type THEN the custom server SHALL ensure consistent routing
4. WHEN handlers are unavailable THEN the custom server SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. IF routing fails THEN the custom server SHALL log detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and health check capabilities, so that I can ensure the system is operating correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN health endpoints SHALL report system status
2. WHEN events are processed THEN metrics SHALL be collected and exposed
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be generated
5. IF components fail THEN the monitoring system SHALL detect and report failures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transaction support and consistency guarantees, so that business operations maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands modify state THEN changes SHALL be atomic within aggregate boundaries
2. WHEN events are published THEN they SHALL be stored transactionally with state changes
3. WHEN saga transactions span multiple aggregates THEN consistency SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN failures occur during transactions THEN partial changes SHALL be rolled back
5. IF concurrent modifications happen THEN optimistic locking SHALL prevent conflicts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want projection and read model capabilities, so that I can efficiently query application state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are published THEN relevant projections SHALL be updated automatically
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL return current projection state
3. WHEN projections need rebuilding THEN the system SHALL support replay from event store
4. WHEN multiple projection instances exist THEN they SHALL maintain consistency
5. IF projection updates fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want event upcasting and schema evolution support, so that I can evolve my event structure over time without breaking existing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN old event versions are read THEN they SHALL be automatically upcasted to current versions
2. WHEN event schemas change THEN the system SHALL handle backward compatibility
3. WHEN upcasting fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN multiple upcasters exist THEN they SHALL be applied in correct sequence
5. IF upcasting is not possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want event scheduling and deadline management, so that I can handle time-based business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deadlines are scheduled THEN they SHALL be persisted and triggered at correct times
2. WHEN scheduled events are due THEN they SHALL be published automatically
3. WHEN system restarts THEN scheduled events SHALL be recovered and continue processing
4. WHEN deadlines are cancelled THEN they SHALL be removed from the schedule
5. IF scheduling fails THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff strategies

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multi-tenancy support, so that I can isolate data and processing for different tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are processed THEN they SHALL be isolated by tenant context
2. WHEN events are stored THEN they SHALL include tenant information
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL only return data for the correct tenant
4. WHEN projections are built THEN they SHALL be tenant-specific
5. IF tenant context is missing THEN the system SHALL reject the operation

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed tracking and correlation, so that I can trace operations across multiple services and instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations span multiple services THEN they SHALL maintain correlation IDs
2. WHEN events are processed THEN tracking information SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN errors occur THEN correlation context SHALL be included in logs
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN complete operation traces SHALL be available
5. IF correlation context is lost THEN the system SHALL generate new tracking identifiers
